# Electric-Lady
 
In order to pay honor and respect for one of my favorite music studios in the world I have decided to create a version of the current website for Electric Lady Studios. Originally create by Jimmy Hendrix and John Storyk. This studio has served as the foundation for many amazing recording sessions that we have today. 

This version of the website is solely for my creative output, this website does not represent Electric Lady Studios in any way or form. 

I want to add special thanks to **Nicolas Urruty** - [nurruty](https://github.com/nurruty) for helping me with the implementation of Open Source Libraries into the project. Vamoh Uruguay!
